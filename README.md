# NeoFract
NeoFract (Neuron Fracture) is software developed using Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNN is a popular model for detecting and recognizing objects in images and serves as an effective solution for estimating the physical parameters of fractures with complex patterns. Fractures, commonly found in everyday contexts such as cracks in soil, rocks, and subsurface fluid flow pathways, may appear as simple lines but often exhibit highly varied geometries influenced by parameters like surface roughness and aperture width. NeoFract was specifically designed to estimate surface roughness coefficients and mean aperture values in fractures.
